Pi Generator is an open source program that generates Ï€ to how many digits you want !
How to use :
You just enter the amount of digits you want in the entry and then press the button. The progress is shown in the progress bar. After the number is generated a .txt file is opened containing the number.
Note : If you enter numbers that are too high ( >= 100000 on most computers ) , during the generation process, the app may go into "Not Responding" mode which is normal.
